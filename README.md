# 👋 Hi, I'm Jessica 
Cloud DevOps Engineer | Scrum Master | Software Engineer

🚀 I'm an aspiring Cloud DevOps Engineer passionate about deploying reliable, scalable applications using AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions, and Infrastructure as Code.

🎓 I received my M.S. in Software Engineering at Kennesaw State University in July 2025, where I served as Scrum Master and DevOps lead on multiple full-stack projects.

## 🛠️ **What I Work With:**
- Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, EBS, basic networking & security groups)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Git, GitHub CLI (branching, workflows, automation)
- Containers: Docker (images, Dockerfiles, local dev environments)
- Scripting & IaC: Bash, PowerShell, YAML, JSON (automation + config management)
- APIs & Dev: REST APIs, Linux, Java fundamentals
- Agile: Scrum, Jira, Confluence, collaborative workflows

## 🛠️ **What I Am Working On:**
- [Raspberry Pi Dashboard:](https://github.com/jnbaum/learningDashboard) building a modular hardware dashboard using GPIO inputs and sensor data.
- _JavaScript Integration: pulling data from the Pi, handling events, and wiring logic with lightweight JS.
- _SvelteKit Frontend: creating small UI widgets driven by Svelte stores and component architecture.
- _Enclosures & Hardware: experimenting with 3D-printed cases and basic electronics for a clean setup.
- _DevOps Practice: versioning everything with Git + automating checks via GitHub Actions.

## 💼 **Finished Projects:**
- [Rovaly](https://github.com/jnbaum/SWE6733-Group-1) - Full-stack adventure-matching app deployed on AWS with CI/CD, Docker, and Agile workflow
- [GRA Inbox Simulator](https://github.com/NMurphyGSU/InboxSimulator) - GDScript-based training simulator using JSON-driven logic and dynamic UIs
- [Scrappy Owl](https://github.com/megdollar/ScrappyOwl) - a UI learning project


## 🎯 **Short-Term Goals:**
- Java Foundations: working through the Liang playlist + Tim Buchalka’s Java Masterclass for stronger OOP and problem-solving.
- AWS Upskilling: preparing for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect and deepening core services (IAM, VPC, EC2, S3).
- REST & Backend Confidence: improving API design/consumption skills and getting more comfortable with backend patterns.
- DevOps Practice: building muscle memory with Git, GitHub Actions, containers, and simple automation workflows.
- Project Pushing: using the Pi dashboard + Svelte widgets to turn theory into actual, working stuff.
